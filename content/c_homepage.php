				While doing some research for this discussion topic, I came across this very comprehensive 
				look at the development of LIS education around the world. Presented as a slideshow, this 
				takes quite some time to read from start to finish, but even a quick flick through it shows 
				a wide variety of ways to become a qualified librarian. It is worth sharing just to acknowledge 
				the huge amount of research that must have gone into creating this!
